# RelationExtraction

This framework is based on this paper: [https://cs.nyu.edu/~thien/pubs/vector15.pdf](https://cs.nyu.edu/~thien/pubs/vector15.pdf)

Review of the paper:

Traditional approaches - relation extractor uses features generated by linguistic analysis modules.

This paper - relation extractor based on  complicated feature engineering by introducing a convolutional neural network that automatically learns features from sentences and minimizes the dependence on external toolkits and resources.

	model - multiple window sizes for filters

		  - pre-trained word embeddings as an initializer on a non-static architecture to improve the performance

		  - unblanced corpus (non-relation examples exceed usual relations.)
